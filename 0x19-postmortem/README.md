Issue Summary:

Duration: The outage occurred from 10:00 AM to 12:30 PM EST.
Impact: During the outage, users were unable to access the web application's login and registration services. This resulted in login failures and prevented new account creations. Around 30% of users were affected by these issues.
Root Cause: The outage stemmed from a misconfiguration in the database connection settings, which occurred during a routine server update.
Timeline:

10:00 AM: The issue was first noticed when monitoring alerts showed a significant increase in failed login attempts.
Actions Taken: Engineers focused on investigating the login and registration services and suspected a possible database connectivity issue. They examined recent server updates and scrutinized server logs for unusual activities.
Misleading Investigation: Initially, engineers suspected a potential DDoS attack due to the sudden surge in failed login attempts. However, further examination revealed no evidence of malicious activity.
Escalation: The incident was escalated to the DevOps team for in-depth analysis and resolution.
Incident Resolution: DevOps engineers identified the misconfiguration in the database connection settings as the root cause and reverted the recent server update to resolve the issue.
Root Cause and Resolution:

The outage resulted from a misconfiguration in the database connection settings, which occurred unintentionally during a routine server update. This misconfiguration disrupted the application servers' connectivity to the database.
To address the issue, DevOps engineers reverted the database connection settings to their previous configuration and implemented additional monitoring measures to detect similar issues promptly.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improve Change Management: Strengthen change management processes to prevent misconfigurations during server updates by incorporating thorough testing and rollback plans.
Enhance Monitoring: Upgrade monitoring systems to enable early detection of database connectivity issues and other critical components.
Conduct Regular Audits: Perform routine audits of server configurations to identify and rectify potential vulnerabilities.
Task List:
Review and update change management procedures to include comprehensive testing and rollback strategies.
Implement automated tests for database connectivity to proactively identify issues.
Conduct a thorough review of server configurations to address any misconfigurations.
Enhance monitoring systems to deliver real-time alerts for critical service disruptions.
Organize regular training sessions for engineering teams to stay informed about system maintenance and troubleshooting best practices.
In conclusion, the outage resulted from a misconfiguration during a routine server update, causing database connectivity issues. By enhancing change management processes, upgrading monitoring systems, and conducting regular audits, we can minimize similar incidents in the future and uphold the stability and reliability of our services.
